# LEARN

Welcome to this project, a collection of notes on topics I'm learning related to DevOps. I'm interested in DevOps because it combines development, operations, and security to create a more efficient and reliable software delivery process. 

Here, I'll be documenting my learnings on various DevOps concepts and tools.  I plan to categorize them by topic (e.g., Git, CI/CD) for easier reference.

This project will be a valuable resource for me to track my progress and revisit concepts in the future. 

The topics will be concentrated on DevOps.

Below is a list of topics that I will cover. This list will be populated as I move forward.
